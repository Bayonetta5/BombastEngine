<b>Core Engine Dependencies:</b>
* zlib 1.2.8
* rapidxml 1.13
* lua-5.2.3

<b>Optional Engine Dependencies:</b>
* PhysX 3.3.2 (Required to use PhysX as Physics Library. By Deafult PhysX is disabled, with BombastPhysics library enabled.)

<b>Editor Dependencies</b>
* Qt 5.6 Beta

Note: Engine is being developed as techniques explored, so some features are being tacked on for my own exploration, even if may not fit nicely into the engine. Despite this, I will try to keep as structured as possible. 

Many decisions were made for educational purposes rather than best practice (ex. near-exclusive use of naked pointers)
