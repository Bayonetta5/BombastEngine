Bombast Engine
=============

C++ 3D Game Engine (DirectX) (WIP)

<b>Core Engine Dependencies:</b>
* PhysX 3.3.2
* zlib 1.2.8
* rapidxml 1.13
* lua-5.2.3

<b>Optional Engine Dependencies:</b>
* PhysX 3.3.2 (Temporarily Required, BombastPhysics can be used instead)

<b>Editor Dependencies</b>
* Qt 5.4

<br/>
Note: Engine is being developed as techniques explored, so some features are being tacked on for my own exploration, even if may not fit nicely into the engine. Despite this, I will try to keep as structured as possible. 

Many decisions were made for educational purposes rather than best practice (ex. near-exclusive use of naked pointers)
