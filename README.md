Bombast Engine
=============

C++ 3D Game Engine (DirectX) (WIP)

<b>Dependencies:</b>
* PhysX 3.3.2
* zlib
* rapidxml
* lua-5.2.3

<br/>
Note: Engine is being developed as techniques explored, so some features are being tacked on for my own exploration, even if may not fit nicely into the engine. Despite this, I will try to keep as structured as possible.
